# Solution to Practice Kattis Programming Challenges

- Most solutions are in Javascript (Mozilla Spidermonkey or NodeJS)
  - Spidermonkey is shown to have a faster runtime in the Kattis environment
- Also a few solutions in Python and C++ *(C++ on average has the fastest runtime in the Kattis test environment)*

## Node_Solutions folder

- This folder is slightly more unique since it also served as a practice folder for:
  - Unit testing (/test folder has some simple chai tests)
  - Typescript compiled to Javascript
    - `npm install`, or `yarn install` node_modules
    - [VS Code specific TS to JS compile instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling)
